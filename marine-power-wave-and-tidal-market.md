<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Power (Wave and Tidal) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wave Power</li><li>Tidal Power</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine power market includes two main types: wave power and tidal power. Wave power harnesses the energy created by ocean waves and converts it into usable electricity. This is done through devices placed either on or near the surface of the water, which capture the wave's movement. Tidal power, on the other hand, utilizes the power of tidal currents to generate electricity. Devices such as turbines or barrages are installed in areas with strong tidal flows to capture the energy produced by the rise and fall of tides.</p></p>
