<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Bio Fuel Oil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Distillate Fuel Oil</li><li>Residual Fuel Oil</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Marine bio fuel oil market primarily consists of two types - distillate fuel oil and residual fuel oil. Distillate fuel oil is a refined petroleum product that is commonly used in smaller vessels and engines due to its lower sulfur content. It is also more expensive compared to residual fuel oil. Residual fuel oil, on the other hand, is a viscous and high-sulfur content oil typically used in larger marine engines. It is cheaper but emits more pollutants, therefore it is subject to stricter regulations. Both types fulfill different needs based on vessel size and emissions standards in marine transportation.</p></p>
