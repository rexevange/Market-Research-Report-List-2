<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Switches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bellows</li><li>Push Button</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air switches are devices used to control the operation of various equipment or appliances by using air pressure. There are two main types of air switches: bellows switches and push button switches. Bellows switches work by sensing changes in air pressure due to the compression and expansion of a flexible diaphragm. On the other hand, push button switches are activated by pressing a button that releases or controls the flow of air. Both types of air switches are commonly used in industrial and commercial applications for their reliable and efficient operation.</p></p>
