<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Titanium Dioxide by Sulfate Process Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rutile Titanium Dioxide</li><li>Anatase Titanium Dioxide</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Titanium dioxide, commonly known as TiO2, is a white pigment widely used in various industries such as paints, plastics, and coatings. The sulfate process is one of the major methods for its production. In this process, naturally occurring titanium-bearing minerals, such as rutile and ilmenite, are first purified and then reacted with sulfuric acid to produce titanium dioxide. There are two types of titanium dioxide based on crystal structure: rutile titanium dioxide and anatase titanium dioxide. Rutile is more commonly used due to its higher opacity and durability, while anatase is preferred for its photocatalytic properties.</p></p>
