<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanizing Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Batch Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Galvanizing flux is used in the process of galvanizing, which involves coating metal surfaces with a protective layer of zinc. There are two main types of galvanizing flux markets: batch type and continuous type. </p><p>Batch type involves a manual and intermittent process, where the galvanizing flux is applied to the metal surface in batches and then the metal is immersed in a zinc bath. This method is suitable for smaller-scale operations.</p><p>Continuous type, on the other hand, is an automated and continuous process where the galvanizing flux is continuously applied to moving metal surfaces as they pass through a zinc bath. This method is more efficient and commonly used in larger-scale operations.</p></p>
