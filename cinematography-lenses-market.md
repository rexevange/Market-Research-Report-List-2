<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cinematography Lenses Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Prime Lenses</li><li>Zoom Lenses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cinematography lenses can be categorized into two main types: prime lenses and zoom lenses. Prime lenses have a fixed focal length, meaning they have a specific angle of view and cannot zoom in or out. These lenses are preferred for their sharpness, wider aperture, and ability to capture images with minimal distortion. On the other hand, zoom lenses have a variable focal length, allowing filmmakers to adjust the magnification of the scene without changing lenses. They offer versatility and convenience, but often sacrifice some image quality compared to prime lenses.</p></p>
